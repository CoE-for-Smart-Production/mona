## Assembly

Before printing, make sure to test the [3D printers
accuracy](https://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html/#flow), as
this ensures an easier assembly. After printing, redrill all screw holes
in the printed object to ensure enough space for the screws to go
through.

Now, the base station needs to be assembled with the help of the
*pre_evaluation_assembly.png* image in the downloaded image folder and
five M3 nuts and screws.

After that, use said image to melt M3 and M4 nuts for the assembly
process into the underside of the base plate with the help of a
soldering iron. Finally, use the paper-based work instruction or create
a new work instruction using the provided images and 3D models to show a
modified assembly process.
